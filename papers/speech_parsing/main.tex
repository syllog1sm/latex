\begin{abstract}

    We present the first joint model of dependency parsing and
    disfluency detection. A standard incremental beam-search model
    proves well suited to the task, achieving much better parsing and disfluency
    detection scores than previous joint \pcfg models.

We then improve the model further, by introducing features targetting disfluency
detection, and a novel non-monotonic transition system designed for speech repairs.
Our final model achieves 83\% disfluency $F$-measure; comparable to the current
state-of-the-art and better than previous incremental models.

\section{Introduction}

Most unscripted speech contains filled pauses (ums and uhs) and errors which are
usually edited on-the-fly by the speaker. Disfluency detection is the task of
marking these infelicities in spoken language transcripts. The task has some
immediate value, as disfluencies have been shown to make speech recognition output
much more difficult to read \citep{jones:03}, but has also been motivated as
a module in a natural language understanding pipeline, because disfluencies have
proven problematic for \pcfg parsing models.

One reason for this difficulty could be the effect of disfluencies on the size
of the grammar that the parser has to learn: even though only 5\% of the tokens
in the Switchboard treebank \citep{marcus:93} are disfluent, they increase
the number of production rules in the corpus by over 50\%.\footnote{With
no nodes labelled \textsc{edted}, \textsc{uh} or \textsc{prn}, there are
2,570 unique productions in sections 2 and 3 of Switchboard. With them,
there are 19,015. Punctuation and metadata nodes were removed before both counts.}

%The underlying problem may be that a \pcfg model incorporates assumptions that
%seem a poor fit for learning disfluent sentences, which are examples of linguistic
%performance, rather than linguistic competence.

Instead of a pipeline approach, we adopt a different type of parsing model,
incremental dependency parsing,
which does not rely on a grammar and makes fewer linguistic assumptions.
The only previous work on dependency parsing of speech that we are aware of
is from \citet{jorgensen:07}, who ran the \textsc{malt} parser on the Switchboard
corpus. Since then, dependency parsers have improved in accuracy substantially,
and now rival the best \pcfg models.
%\footnote{The parsers described by
%\citet{zhang:11} and \citet{Charniak05a} both recover unlabelled Stanford basic
%dependencies with about 93.5\% accuracy on the Wall Street Journal.}

Our first experiment is to apply a state-of-the-art incremental dependency parser
`out-of-the-box', with disfluencies simply marked by giving them a distinct
dependency label. A standard beam-search structured perceptron parser
\citep{zhang:cl11,zhang:11} recovered unlabelled dependencies between fluent words
with TODO\% accuracy, and detected disfluencies with 70\% $F$-measure.
We then describe methods of customising the feature set and transition system
of the parser to deal with disfluencies, which together improve these scores
substantially.

Our disfluency features were designed to capture the
`rough copy' structure of some speech repairs, which motivates the
\citet{Johnson04a} noisy channel model.  These features improve disfluency
$F$-measure to 79\%, similar to the noisy channel model.  The ease with which
incremental dependency parsers can incorporate arbitrary features is one of
their principal advantages.

The second improvement is a novel non-monotonic extension to the transition
system. It allows the parser to create temporary edges, in order to deal with
speech repairs where the head of an apparent constituent is disfluent, but some
of its apparent leftward children are not.

The joint system achieves competitive accuracy at both disfluency detection and
parsing. It also has other important advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Because the parser is incremental, it does not require sentence segmentation
        as a pre-process. Segmenting spoken utterances is a difficult unsolved
        problem, that will probably benefit from syntactic information. Our parser
        is the first to make this possible.

    \item The system is also quite efficient, processing 488 tokens per second.
        Little work has been done on making disfluency detection systems efficient,
        which has greatly limited their use. Previous models have required either
        large ngram language models \citep{zwarts:11}, a \pcfg syntactic language
        model \citep{Johnson04a}, or several passes over the data \citep{qian:13}.

    \item Finally, by casting the problem of disfluency detection as a minimally
           different dependency parsing task, our system will be able to exploit
           future improvements to incremental dependency parsing —-- an area of
           research that is currently very active.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

\subsection{Speech disfluencies}

\subsection{Transition-based dependency parsing}

Our parsing model is adapted from \citet{zhang:cl11}, who use beam-search guided
by a global (`structured') averaged perceptron model \citep{collins:02}.

Briefly, the transition-based parser consists of a state (sometimes termed a
configuration) which is sequentially manipulated by actions chosen from a set
termed the transition system. We use the arc-eager transition system
\citep{nivre:03,nivre:cl}.

We use a notation in which the stack items are indicated by S$i$, with S0 being
the top of the stack, S1 the item previous to it and so on. Similarly, buffer
items are indicated as N$i$, with N0 being the first item on the buffer. The arcs
are of the form ($h$, $l$, $m$), indicating a dependency in which the word m modifies
the word $h$ with label $l$.

In the initial configuration the stack is empty, and the buffer contains the words
of the sentence followed by an artificial \textsc{root} token, as suggested by
\citet{nivre:squib}.
In the final configuration the buffer is empty and the stack contains the 
\textsc{root} token. The set of arcs in the final configuration is the parse tree.

There are four parsing actions (\textbf{S}hift, \textbf{L}eft-Arc,
\textbf{R}ight-Arc and Re\textbf{d}uce, abbreviated as S,L,R,D respectively)
that manipulate stack and buffer items. The Shift action pops the first item
from the buffer and pushes it on the stack (the Shift action has a natural
precondition that the buffer is not empty, as well as a precondition that
\textsc{root} can only be pushed to an empty stack). The Right-Arc action is
similar to the Shift action, but it also adds a dependency arc (S0, N0),
with the current top of the stack as the head of the newly pushed item (the Right
action has an additional precondition that the stack is not empty). The Left-Arc
action adds a dependency arc (N0, S0) with the first item in the buffer as the
head of the top of the stack, and pops the stack (with a precondition that the
stack and buffer are not empty, and that S0 is not assigned a head yet). Finally,
the Reduce action pops the stack, with a precondition that the stack is not empty
and that S0 is already assigned a head.

\subsection{Dynamic oracle training}

An essential component when training a transition-based parser is an oracle which,
given a gold-standard tree, dictates the sequence of moves a parser should make
in order to derive it. Traditionally, these oracles are defined as functions from
trees to sequences, mapping a gold tree to a single sequence of actions deriving it,
even if more than one sequence of actions derives the gold tree. During training,
the model encounters a loss if its prediction departs from this single gold-standard
sequence, even if its prediction could be along an alternate path to a gold-standard tree.

The oracle that \citep{goldberg:12} define, which they term a \emph{dynamic} oracle,
instead calculates how many gold-standard arcs will be newly unreachable after a
given action has been performed on the parser’s current configuration. This allows
the model to be trained with a loss function that refers to the dependency structure,
instead of the transition history.

In the context of a greedy parser, the biggest ad- vantage is that the `static'
oracle can only label states along the path to the gold-standard derivation.
This meant that states encountered at run- time diverged from those seen during
training, once the parser made a mistake. Beam-search parsers have never suffered
from that problem, and so the idea has not yet been applied to training a beam-search
parser.

The dynamic oracle is important for this work because it allows us to under-specify
some of the parse structure —-- specifically, the structure surrounding disfluencies.
One motivation is that we suspect the gold-standard parses for disfluent regions
to be noisy, especially once run through the dependency converter. Since we do
not have a use for this structure, and it is likely to be inconsistent with the
rest of the grammar, it makes sense to not try to learn it. The other motivation
is described in Section \ref{sec:edit_trans}. We argue that for examples like
\emph{a red square uh rectangle}, it is useful to allow the parser to create arcs
from disfluent words to fluent ones, which will later be deleted. The new
transition introduces substantial spurious ambiguity, as the transition system
is no longer monotonic, so a dynamic oracle is required for training.

\section{Dependency conversion}

We train our parser on the Switchboard section of the Penn Treebank \citep{marcus:93},
using the 2013-04-05 version of the Stanford dependency converter \citep{stanford_deps}.
At first we feared that the filled pauses, disfluencies and meta-data tokens in
the Switchboard corpus might disrupt the conversion process, by making it more
difficult for the converter to recognise the underlying production rules.

To test this, we prepared two versions of the cor- pus, both with oracle pre-processing:
one where \textsc{edited} nodes, filled pauses and meta-data were cleaned before
the trees were sent through the Stanford converter, and one where the disfluency
cleaning was performed after the dependency conversion. The resulting corpora
were largely identical: 99.54\% of unlabelled and 98.7\% of labelled dependencies
were the same.

The fact that the Stanford converter is robust to the disfluencies is good news
for our baseline model. In our \textsc{edit} model, the structure of disfluent
constituents is under-specified; but for the baseline model, we use the structure
output by the Stanford converter.

We follow previous work on disfluency detection in lower-casing the text and
removing punctuation and unrecognisable words. We also filter out one- and two-token
sentences.

\section{Features for the joint parser}

Our baseline parser uses the feature set described by \citet{zhang:11}.
To describe the features, we use the following notation. First, we name the
12 context tokens shown in Figure ??. These are the word on top of the stack, its
left and right subtree, its parent and its grandparent; the first word of the buffer
and its leftward subtree (it cannot have a rightward subtree); and the next two
tokens of the buffer (these also cannot have subtrees or parents).

Atomic features consist of the word, part-of- speech tag, or dependency label
for these tokens, and feature templates often consist of multiple fea- ture atoms
in combination. We refer the reader to \citet{zhang:11} for the specific feature
templates used.

\section{A non-monotonic Edit transition}

One of the reasons that joint disfluency detection and parsing is hard is due to
what ? terms helical dependency structures. Figure ?? shows a simple example.
The repair square replaces the reparan- dum5 rectangle, and must be attached to
the rest of the fluent sentence.

The problematic dependencies, shown in dotted lines, are between `rectangle'
and `a' and `red'. These arcs are not exactly correct, as we do not want them in
a final projective tree, but they are also not exactly incorrect, in the way that
an arc from `a' to `pass' or `me' would be.

For a transition-based model, learning to avoid these arcs is very difficult.
Unless the interruption point is within the look-ahead into the buffer, the
incremental model cannot guess that ‘rect- angle’ will later prove disfluent,
so trying to learn disfluency-specific behaviour at this point seems a bad strategy.
What we want instead is for the parser to apply whatever it has learned about English
grammar to this decision, and later arrive at a state that is inconsistent with
that grammar, forcing it to mark rectangle as disfluent.

We achieve this by adding a new transition, \edittrans, to the arc-eager system.
The \edittrans transition marks the top word of the stack and its rightward subtree
as disfluent, but returns its leftward children to the stack, and deletes a
dependency to it if one exists.

Figure ?? shows a before-and-after example. In the configuration above, rectangle
is on top of the stack (indicated by circling the word). After the \textsc{edit}
transition, it is marked as disfluent (crossed), the arc to it is deleted, and its
leftward children (empha and red) are restored to the stack. The substructures
of these children are not rebuilt —-- we do not delete the arc from bright to red,
or restore bright to the stack.

Why revisit the leftward children, but not the right? The logic here is that we are
concerned about dependencies which might be ‘mirrored’ be- tween the reparandum
and the repair. The rightward subtree of the disfluency might well be incorrect,
but if it is, it would still be incorrect if the word on top of the stack weren’t
disfluent —-- so we regard these as parsing errors that we will train our model
to avoid. In contrast, avoiding the left- ward arcs would require the parser to
predict that the head is disfluent, when it has not necessarily seen any evidence
indicating that.

The EDIT transition makes the transition system non-monotonic, in the terms of ?,
who showed that a greedy arc-eager parser became more accurate when given a limited
ability to correct for incorrect transitions. We use a beam-search parser, which
is well equipped to correct for the cases which the non-monoticity they introduce
helps with. We therefore restrict our parser’s non-monotonic behaviour to the
EDIT transition.

The \edittrans transition introduces substantial spurious ambiguity: there are multiple
transition sequences that could yield the gold-standard dependencies. We therefore
adopt the `dynamic oracle' training method of \citet{goldberg:12} described in
Section 3.1.

Line 1 shows a state resulting resulting from a Right-Arc (R) from noticed to that.
Previously, the parser had performed a Left-Arc from noticed to I, which is no
longer on the stack. The itali- cised words in the buffer are disfluent, and will
be deleted using the \edittrans transition. Deletions will be marked by strike-through.

Line 2 shows the state after the Shift move (S)
move has pushed the and monthly onto the stack. It would be correct to apply the
Edit transition to this configuration, but that is only one of several moves that
the dynamic oracle (Sections ??) would assign zero-cost during training.

The model selects a different zero-cost action, Left-Arc, which pops monthly and
attaches it to salary. The parser then performs another Left- Arc, attaching the
fluent word the to the disfluent word salary, resulting in the state at Line 3.

The critical difference between the EDIT model and the baseline is that this type
of arc is also zero- cost in the EDIT model, because we will later put the back
onto the stack. Our argument is that from the configuration in Line 2, the Left-Arcs
are the natural choice, and a loss-function that penalises this move will be
unlearnable. The state resulting from these two actions is shown in Line 3.

The parser’s next action is a Right-Arc from the fluent noticed to the disfluent
\emph{salary}, pushing salary onto the stack. This action is also zero-cost,
even though it creates an erroneous arc, because we’ll later have the chance to
delete the arc via the EDIT transition. The parser then performs a series of
Shift and Left-Arc moves, attaching the fluent tokens starting, monthly and
average to the sec- ond disfluent salary token. These arcs are all also zero-cost,
and are further examples of the type of arc that motivates the \edittrans transition.

The parser is now (Line 4) in a state from which it can confidently predict that
the salary token on top of the stack is disfluent, as there is a matching word at
the start of the buffer that isn’t one of the small set of words that are often
repeated in the training data. The word-match features will also find a match
between the tokens S0L0 and N0L0 (first left child of S0 and first left child
of N0).

Line 5 shows the state that results from the \edittrans transition. It marks salary as
disfluent, deletes all arcs to and from it, pops it from the stack, and restores
its leftward children to the stack — in this case, monthly. The parser’s next
action is to mark monthly as disfluent. A Left-Arc, Shift, or even Right-Arc
would all have been zero-cost from this state, because the word on top of the
stack and the word at the start of the buffer are both disfluent. Instead, the
word-match between S0 and N0L0, combined with the fact that the token after S0
was marked disfluent, leads the parser to mark monthly as also disfluent.

The parser next applies the Left-Arc transition from the disfluent salary to the
fluent the, again at zero-cost, even though the arc is incorrect. The Shift move
then puts the parser in the state shown on Line 7: the disfluent salary is at
the top of the stack, with several fluent words as leftward chil- dren, and its
repair is at the start of the buffer. The word-match feature between S0 and N0
fires, encouraging the parser to select the EDIT transition, which restores the,
starting, average and monthly to the stack, resulting in the state on Line 9.

Having successfully marked the disfluencies, the parser performs a series of
Left-Arcs, before correctly attaching salary to noticed via the Right- Arc,
and happens to correctly attach the preposi- tional phrase as well.
